# STRATOS

Here is the tree directory explanation

- *temperature_PCA_anomal/*: analysis of temperatures (principal component analysis and anomalies). 
It is a folder because we have several `.py` files containing functions in order to organize the code.

- *analysis_height.py*: computes a similar analysis as the temperature one.
- *functions_height.py*: contains all the functions used in this analysis.

- *mendonca.py*: code where we tried to reproduced calculations explained in Mendon√ßa's paper (variations in T and h).

- *tr_ana_entriesandmultiplicity.py*: analysis of Tragaldabas detector data. Two different objectives: 
    + spatial distribution of entries (CM, std, main direction, etc) 
    + multiplicity linear fit (double log scale).
