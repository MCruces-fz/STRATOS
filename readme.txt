folder temperature_PCA_anomal: 
analysis of temperatures (principal component analysis and anomalies)
it is a folder because we have several .py containing functions in order to organize the code

analysis_height.py: computes a similar analysis as the temperature one
functions_height.py: contains all the functions used in this analysis

mendonca.py: code where we tried to reproduced calculations explained in Mendon√ßa's paper (variations in T and h)

tr_ana_entriesandmultiplicity.py: analysis of tragaldabas detector data
two different objectives: spatial distribution of entries (CM, std, main direction, etc) and multiplicity linear fit (double log scale)
